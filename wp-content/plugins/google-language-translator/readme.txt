* Adjusted some minor spacing issues in the settings page HTML (caused some annoying red HTML errors when using "View Source" in right-click menu).
* Removed old CSS styles that were added in the previous 3.0 update - the styles were added when Google servers were being updated, and were producing major translation dislay issues until their update was complete.  Now the styles I added are no longer needed.

= 3.0 =
* Correct a small CSS error that affected the showing/hiding of the Google toolbar.

= 2.9 =
***IMPORTANT: Google's most recent server update is producing display issues for website translation tool.

Please direct any support requests through Wordpress.org and we will be happy to assist you.

When activated, users can hover over the text of their website, and edit the translations from the webpage directly.  Google will remember these translations, and then serve them to users once the edits are made. Users must install the Google Translate Customization meta tag provided through Google Translate here: translate.google.com/manager/website/settings. To obtain this meta tag, users need to configure the Google Translate tool directly from this website (although they will not use this because the plugin provides it), then the user can obtain the meta tag on the "Get Code" screen, which is displayed after configuring the Google Translate tool on this webpage.
* Added an option to allow users to turn on/off Google's multilanguagePage option, that when activated, the original website content will be a forced translation, instead of original content (but only after a translation is made.)

= 2.5 =

* Added link in the settings panel that points to Google's Attribution Policy.

= 2.1 =
* Added language "Dutch" to the Original Language drop-down option on the settings page.
* Added a new CSS class that more accurately hides the "Powered by" text when hiding Google's branding. In previous version, the "Powered by" text was actually disguised by setting it's color to "transparent", but now we have set it's font-size to 0px instead.

= 2.0 =
* Corrected some immediate errors in the 1.9 update.

= 1.9 =
* Added 7 flag image choices that, when clicked by website visitors, will change the language displayed, both on the website, AND in the drop-down box (flag language choices are limited to those provided in this plugin).
* Added 6 additional languages to the translator, as provided in Google's most recent updates ( new languages include Bosnian, Cebuano, Khmer, Marathi, Hmong, Javanese ).
* Corrected a minor technical issue where the Czech option (on the backend) was incorrectly displaying the Croatian language on the front end.
* Added jQuery functionality to the settings panel to improve the user experience.
* Added an option for users to display/hide the flag images.
* Added an option for users to display/hide the translate box when flags are displayed.
* Removed the settings.css file - I found a better way of displaying the options without CSS.

= 1.8 =
* Modified google-language-translator.php to display the correct output to the browser when horizontal layout is selected.  Previously, it was not displaying at all.

= 1.7 =
* Modified google-language-translator.php so that jQuery and CSS styles were enqueued properly onto the settings page only. Previously, jQuery functionality and CSS styles were being added to all pages of the Wordpresss Dashboard, which was causing functionality and display issues for some users.

= 1.6 =
* Added "Specific Language" support to the plugin settings, which allows the user to choose specific languages that are displayed to website visitors.

= 1.5 =
Added "Original Language" support to the plugin settings, which allows the user to choose the original language of their website, which ultimately removes the original language as a choice in the language drop-down presented to website visitors.

= 1.4 =
Corrected display problems associated with CSS styles not being placed correctly in wp_head.

= 1.3 =
* HTML display problem in the sidebar area now fixed. Previously, inserting the [google-translator] plugin into a text widget caused it to display above the widget, instead of inside of it.

= 1.2 =
* Shortcode support is now available for adding [google-translator] to text widgets. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

= 1.1 =
* The shortcode supplied on the settings page was updated to display '[google-translator]'.
